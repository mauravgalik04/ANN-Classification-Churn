The following is a Classification Neural Network Model which has been on the upload Churn_Modelling.csv file,
which contains data of 1000 customer including their balance, creditscore, estimated salary, age, gender, tenure etc.


The file "model.h5" contains the classification model which can be used to make prediction on custom data if you want.
The model predicts whether a customer would churn or not based on the data provided.

I will also be making another model solving a regression problem which would estimate the salary of the customer.
It would be uploaded by the name of "regressionModel.h5" possibly.
